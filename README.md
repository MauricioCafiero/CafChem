# CafChem
Libraries/modules for the CafChem tools

also see the list of [commonly used code snippets](https://github.com/MauricioCafiero/CafChem/blob/main/Tips_and_Oneliners.md).

## CafChemSubs
- generate analogues of a molecule (from SMILES strings) using generative mask-filling and/or substitutions on phenyl rings.
- Can also calculate some properties (QED, etc) related to drug design.
- visualize molecules. 
## CafChemReDock
- dock molecular SMILES strings in a protein using DockString and save poses.
- Calculate the interaction between a docking pose and a trimmed protein active site using Meta's UMA MLIP.
- visualize molecules.
## Example notebooks
- the notebooks folder contains Colab notebooks to demonstrate each CafChem library
